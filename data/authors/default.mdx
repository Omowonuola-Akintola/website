Hi, my name is Omowonuola [uh-mon-woh-nu-oh-lah] but you can call me Ola (uh-la or HOLA)!!


I am passionate about technology, mapping, and innovation and their power to transform lives across the globe. I love openess and believe democratizing knowledge and technology is the 
only way to level the playing field. This love is borne out of not having all the answers to questions I had. I write to answer some of these questions and also speak about this in conferences and webinars.

I have spent most of my career using open geospatial data and technology to make communities visible and enable data-driven development. My work focuses on improving data availability across Africa to 
support local decision-making mostly for (1) electrification planning and (2) in humanitarian sector - where I currently work.

## Direction

I think deeply about communities and believe that the people who live close to the problem should solve them. How?

Locally-driven research and innovation is crucial for developing solutions that effectively address the specific challenges faced by local communities, but the current technical and 
data gaps in Africa is too huge. I am currently pursuing my Masters in [Earth Observation and AI](https://master-cde.eu) to allow me contribute to solving some of these problems. My focus will be in two folds:

- building open source tools that reduce accessibility to using Earth Observation data and AI, check out [pySARflow](https://pypi.org/project/pysarflow/)

- contributing to research to solve some of these data problems.

## Volunteer community work

My community work involves bridging the digital divide to ensure that local talents have resources they need to contribute meaningfully through [organizing conferences](https://www.youtube.com/@gisfest), 
[podcasting](https://open.spotify.com/show/0LGHyoUC6EIj1T8djbDBne), and designing education programs. My most recent contribution here is designing [The Women Learn Program WLP](https://omowonuola-akintola.github.io/website/projects) 
to equip women from developing countries with relevant technology skills that allows them to contribute to projects within their community. I hope to also contribute to policy research to ensure that there are proper policy that supports 
the adoption of geospatial technology in Africa.

In my free time, I like to disturb the people I love and [take pictures of the world](https://www.pexels.com/@ola-a-2155229019/).
