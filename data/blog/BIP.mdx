## INTRODUCTION 
The storymap below captures my experience during the Blended Intensive Program (BIP) on Quantifying Vulnerability to Natural 
Hazards in Changing Climate Patterns, hosted by the University of Bucharest in Romania. Through a mix of virtual sessions and
fieldwork across Romania, we explored how physical landscapes, social systems, and adaptation strategies shape 
vulnerability in multi-hazard environments. 

For a better experience, you can also access the storymap directly using this [link](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195aa8ee525446fcbfbdd8b2e9a6ea28)
