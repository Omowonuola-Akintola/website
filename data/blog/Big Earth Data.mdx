## INTRODUCTION

With the huge amount of satellite imagery captured daily, making sense of Big Earth Data can be overwhelming. To efficiently process and extract
meaningful insights from imagery spanning over several months is a challenge at the core of modern Earth Observation (EO) analytics.

EO Data Cubes and Cloud computing platforms have emerged as powerful solutions for handling and analyzing large-scale satellite datasets. These platforms 
allow users to access, process, and visualize geospatial data with ease, making them invaluable for different applications.

## Methodology

**Data collection and Processing**
-High-resolution drone imagery from June 2022 was downloaded from [OpenAerialMap](https://openaerialmap.org). OpenAerialMap is an open platform 
for free drone imagery.
- The individual image swath was mosaic'd

**Image Segmentation and Classification**
- The image was segmented and training samples collected; building and non-building.
- K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm was applied for the classification to extract features from the imagery. Non-building features were discarded.

**Estimating Building Density**
- Buildings were categorized based on distribution using a **1km by 1km grid**.

## Result
The buildings were mapped into **high-density**, **medium-density**, and **low-density zones**.

## Presentation 

The project was presented in a scientific poster format.

## CONCLUSION

This approach provides a scalable, efficient alternative to building extraction, enabling 
more effective planning and humanitarian support in refugee settings.
