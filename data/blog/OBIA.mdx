Established in 1992 to provide humanitarian aid during the Sudanese civil war, Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya has grown 
into one of the largest refugee settlements, hosting over 176,000 people from South Sudan, Somalia, and other nations in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, according to a 2023 UNHCR report. While refugee camps like Kakuma aim to provide shelter and aid, they 
often expand rapidly and informally, making it challenging to monitor changes through on-the-ground methods.

Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is a powerful methodology for extracting meaningful spatial information from high-resolution imagery
to support effective planning and resource allocation. 


## Methodology

**Data collection and Processing**
-High-resolution drone imagery from June 2022 was downloaded from [OpenAerialMap](https://openaerialmap.org). OpenAerialMap is an open platform 
for free drone imagery.
- The individual image swath was mosaic'd

**Image Segmentation and Classification**
- The image was segmented and training samples collected; building and non-building.
- K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm was applied for the classification to extract features from the imagery. Non-building features were discarded.

**Estimating Building Density**
- Buildings were categorized based on distribution using a **1km by 1km grid**.

## Result
The buildings were mapped into **high-density**, **medium-density**, and **low-density zones**.

## Presentation 

The project was presented in a scientific poster format.

## CONCLUSION

This approach provides a scalable, efficient alternative to building extraction, enabling 
more effective planning and humanitarian support in refugee settings.
