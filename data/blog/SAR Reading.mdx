Definition:

Microwave Sensing : A sort of process where we use the electromagnetic wavelengths with microwave energy to
create images of the Earth.

Remote Sensing: The science of observing from a distance. In this case, satellites are observing the earth from space.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) : ??

## Introduction

This is an informal writing and personal notes as I read through 'The Essential of SAR' By Thomas P. Ager. I started 
scribbling some notes in the paper back but for some reasons decided to make them digital. I am sensing this is the best way to stay consistent
with reading.

## Why do we need Microwave sensing

- Earth presents major obstacles for satellites: cloud, darkness, with the polar region having ones that lasts for months, atmospheric gases (Water Vapor, CO2), atmospheric particles(smog, dust).

## How 

In remote sensing, what to consider is how different wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum interact with the Earth’s atmosphere.
- Optical and thermal sensors only work in certain “windows”, where the atmosphere does not absorb too much.
- The main usable window is between 0.4 and 14 µm. Sentinel 2 uses range between 0.44–2.2 µm and Landsat uses 0.4–12 µm, both are placed within
clear atmospheric windows.
- Outside this range, absorption by water vapor and other gases is so strong that optical and thermal sensing becomes impossible, even if there are no clouds.
- This is why we need to use longer wavelengths (microwaves), which can pass through clouds, darkness, and most atmospheric gases.
- Microwave's range in the spectrum is between 1mm to 30 centimeter and SAR missions cover ~2.5 cm (X-band) to ~100 cm (P-band).

## Wavelenghts affect resolution but HOW??

This can only make sense when we try to understand how camera works and specific terms like focal length, field of view. I am not sure how deep I want to go yet.

But for now, the resolution angle is roughly equal to the wavelength divided by the size of the lens. 

$$
\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{D}
