### Preamble

This article is the final piece in a three-part series exploring the true potential of EO in Africa. Read[Part 1](https://omowonuola-akintola.github.io/website/blog/The%20State%20of%20EO%20in%20Africa) and [Part 2](https://omowonuola-akintola.github.io/website/blog/How%20Global%20Economies%20Built) first.

## Introduction

Earth Observation (EO) operates across a spectrum of use cases, each with different requirements, value potential, and commercial models. 
A useful way to understand this is the “5 Ms of EO”: Mapping, Measuring, Monitoring, Modeling, and Managing proposed by TerraWatch Space. I 
believe this framework is helpful for understanding the different ways EO creates value and for identifying which of those can already support 
commercial business models, and which still depend on policy and incentives to become viable.

We can already see this playing out across different sectors. In areas like agriculture, mining, finance, and disaster management, EO is increasingly 
aligned with existing demands, workflows, and funding mechanisms making commercial uptake more feasible. In others, such as logistics or renewable 
energy, the value is evident but the business case is still evolving. This suggests that the market structure for EO will likely develop in two ways:

1. By delivering targeted solutions in sector-specific verticals (e.g. agriculture, mining, disaster management), and
2. By strengthening horizontal service layers that cut across sectors and absorb EO as embedded intelligence.

In fact, some of the commercial examples shared in this article reflect EO-backed services that have already been deployed across Africa. These cases 
demonstrate that a functioning market exists, but we still have limited visibility into the true scale of that market and how often demand recurs. 
Understanding that gap is key to building local models that can scale sustainably.

In this article, we explore how EO can support specific market sectors in Africa and examine each sector through a practical lens: identifying the existing systems,
the decisions currently being made, and crucially, who would be willing to pay for EO-powered insights and why. By doing so, we also categorize where each sector falls 
within the 5Ms framework to better understand where commercial value can be unlocked.

## Agriculture

Agriculture has always been at the core of African economies. Over 60% of the continent's population is engaged in farming, according to the [African Development Bank Group](https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Generic-Documents/Brochure_Feed_Africa_-En.pdf). It remains the most mature and immediate opportunity 
for Earth Observation (EO) in Africa being inherently spatial, seasonal, and highly sensitive to environmental variables like rainfall, soil health, and crop disease.  EO’s role
in agriculture spans multiple levels of complexity, from simple mapping of farmland to real-time monitoring of crop risk, and even detecting abandoned or shifting cultivation patterns 
in conflict zones. The continent already has operational systems in place, including government subsidy programs, food security assessments like Cadre Harmonisé, and a growing number of 
digital agri-platforms. These programs require regular decisions on where to distribute inputs, how to respond to climate stress, and who qualifies for credit or aid. Global EO programs 
like NASA Harvest are also demonstrating how satellite data can transform agricultural monitoring across Africa. 

The [World Bank](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099121724052032538/pdf/P50868911ad1820b19f72108f2b8e2dea5.pdf) warns that climate change could reduce staple crop yields in Sub-Saharan Africa by up to 20% by 2050. As climate change disrupts planting cycles and food security becomes a 
geopolitical concern, the future of global agriculture will increasingly rely on EO.

## Disaster 

Disaster response is one of the most urgent and commercially under-explored opportunities for Earth Observation (EO) in Africa. As floods, droughts, 
and displacement events grow more frequent and intense, EO offers the ability to track, forecast, and respond to these shocks in ways traditional systems 
cannot match. While EO is already used in global humanitarian response, its integration into commercial services like climate insurance, logistics disruption alerts, 
and parametric risk financing remains early-stage on the continent.

Models that combine freely available EO data with alerting tools can be sold as: SaaS platforms, APIs to insurers/logistics, and outcome-based contracts with donors.
The most viable EO business models will be those that are lightweight, embedded, and sensitive to the on-ground realities that African communities face every day.

- **Used in Africa**: Yes, partnered with African Risk Capacity (ARC) and the World Food Programme (WFP) in [Sudan](https://www.floodbase.com/case-studies/sudan) and [DR Congo](https://www.floodbase.com/case-studies/sudan).

## Finance/Investment 

Investors, insurers, and regulators are under growing pressure to understand where assets are exposed, how landscapes are changing, and whether climate and ESG claims are verifiable. EO makes it possible to measure these things at scale,
over time, and with global consistency especially in markets where field audits are limited or too costly. The impact cuts across different sectors like real estate, agriculture and carbon market where it underpins Monitoring, Reporting and 
Validation (MVR) for climate finance, forestry and conservation to verify land use, and infrastructure to help banks monitor project exposure. These use cases are already in motion, and in many cases, commercially driven.

In Africa, EO-backed risk analytics are increasingly relevant for green bonds, blended finance programs, and sustainable infrastructure deals.

## Mining 

EO-backed analytics are already playing a role in asset-heavy industries like mining and extractives, where companies face 
pressure to demonstrate environmental compliance, avoid land conflicts, and meet international ESG standards. In the African 
context, where informal mining is widespread and ground monitoring is expensive, EO offers a cost-effective way to scale environmental
oversight and build investor trust.

## Renewable Energy

Electricity remains one of Africa’s most persistent infrastructure gaps  where power cuts are routine and grid expansion is slow. Across the continent, governments, developers, and off-grid 
providers are racing to fill this gap with solar, wind, and hybrid energy systems, often under tight budgets and limited visibility. Yet even as this transformation gains pace, energy developers, 
governments, and financiers face familiar bottlenecks and this is where Earth Observation (EO) can support.

### Logistic and Transport

In logistics, time is money and disruption is risk. Logistics and EO seem like a natural fit, especially for infrastructure planning and flood risk awareness but the commercial model 
is still unclear. Globally, EO is embedded into risk platforms, infrastructure tools, or planning models that logistics firms depend on. This enables companies to anticipate and mitigate
the impact of adverse events such on supply chain operations and infrastructure exposure along key logistics corridors.

Here, EO presents a valuable complement as a layer of infrastructure intelligence that can be embedded into broader logistics platforms. Rather than being standalone, EO can be absorbed by
the systems that keep these companies moving.

## Conclusion

Earth Observation is clearly valuable and in many sectors, the technical case is already proven. But a commercially viable EO market doesn’t grow on technology alone. There need to be incentives 
to adopt, standards to follow, and systems that reward accountability. And that’s where policy still has a critical role to play. Without policy signals, many of these EO use cases will remain stuck 
and unable to scale. 

At the same time, it’s important to remember that many EO use cases are already possible today using free, open satellite data. Sectors like agriculture, disaster response, and finance already have clear 
entry points. The next step is to build tools and services that adapt to technical constraints, simplify delivery, and speak directly to the needs of users on the ground. But building a viable EO market 
in Africa also means understanding our own markets. The market structure, purchasing power, and demand patterns across the continent are fundamentally different. Companies are already solving real problems
often without knowing that EO could make those solutions faster, cheaper, or smarter.  The opportunity isn’t just to introduce new technology, but to prove that EO can reduce operating costs and improve outcomes 
in ways that make commercial sense.
